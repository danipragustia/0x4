# About

Hi, My name is Dani Pragustia,
This blog about things that interest me, most is about software and technology and sometimes mumble about something around the world and myself.

English isn't my primary language, for mostly time I using Bahasa Indonesia.

### Favourites
- I like almost any kind of game, if that doesnt make me <b>bad mood</b>
- Mostly my music is <b>classical music</b>, but i like the music if it good at my taste
- I enjoy book with genres like <b>science fiction, mystery, history</b>

### My Computer

I using old computer from 2015, still good for my daily use. All Software i use run smoothly without any problems. I am using <b>Alpine Linux</b> for OS with Windows 10 for sake of gaming, i cant run QEMU cause processor doesnt include with Intergrated Graphic Card.
- Motherboard is <b>GA-78LMT-S2P</b>, I know this motherboard so bad, will replace soon with Good Motherboard with Support USB3.0 and SATA3
- Processor is <b>AMD FX-6300</b>, i using this process because it doesnt pre-built with the proprietary PSP (Platform Security Processor) module.
- <b>8 GB DDR3</b>, this capable for multi-tasking, it doesnt load up so much on linux (highest using is 70%~ on full active workstation). no upgrade planning future.
- <b>MSI Nvidia GT 730</b>, sometimes for killing-time i play retro game, and this good choice for me beside the price this GPU, this doesnt need external power.
- <b>1 TB HDD Seagate Barracuda</b>, i often fill up my HDD, highest using is only 30%~. I always transfer my data off-site to Flash Drive / External HDD, need upgrade to SSD for speed time and good R/W.
